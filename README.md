# Manage State and External Data in React

Modify the starter app which can be run locally to verify the results. 
Connect to an external API to fetch some data for display based on user selection or input. 
Use any free API and a select list for the user to utilize.
 
## App State

Keep state as low as possible.

1. Local State
2. Lift State
3. Global State (with context)

Once you are dealing with Global State, just stick with `useState`.

## External Data

React Query (with context) or some similar approach to fetching data from an API and getting it into a context.
